    "\n",
    "**Recap of Previous Lecture:**\n",
    "- **Descriptive Models:** Center-surround and oriented receptive fields.\n",
    "- **Question:** How are oriented receptive fields constructed from center-surround receptive fields?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mechanistic Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Neuroanatomy of Visual System:**\n",

    "# 1.4 The Electrical Personality of Neurons\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Neurobiology 101 lecture, several key concepts about neurons and their functions were covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Neuron Structure**:\n",
    "   - Neurons are the primary cells in the brain, acting as the main units for communication.\n",
    "   - **Dendrites**: Branch-like structures that receive signals from other neurons.\n",
    "   - **Axon**: A slender extension that transmits signals away from the neuron.\n",
    "   - **Cell Body**: Contains the nucleus and integrates signals received by the dendrites.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Neuron Types**:\n",
    "   - **Pyramidal Neurons**: Found in the visual cortex; named for their triangular cell bodies.\n",
    "   - **Purkinje Cells**: Located in the cerebellum; characterized by their extensive branching dendrites.\n",
    "   - **Optic Tectum Cells**: Have diverse branching structures depending on their location.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Neuron Doctrine**:\n",
    "   - States that neurons are discrete units of the brain and not continuous with other cells.\n",
    "   - Information flows from dendrites through the cell body and along the axon.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Electrical Properties**:\n",
    "   - Neurons maintain a resting membrane potential of approximately -70 mV.\n",
    "   - This potential difference is due to ionic gradients maintained by pumps and channels in the cell membrane.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ionic Channels**:\n",
    "   - **Voltage-Gated Channels**: Open or close in response to changes in membrane voltage.\n",
    "   - **Chemically-Gated Channels**: Open or close in response to the binding of chemicals.\n",
    "   - **Mechanically-Gated Channels**: Open or close in response to mechanical pressure or stretch.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Action Potential**:\n",
    "   - Generated when a neuron reaches a threshold level of depolarization.\n",
    "   - Involves a rapid influx of sodium ions followed by an outflux of potassium ions.\n",
    "   - Propagates along the axon through a process called saltatory conduction, facilitated by myelin sheaths and Nodes of Ranvier.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Myelination**:\n",
    "   - **Myelin Sheaths**: Insulating layers around axons that speed up signal transmission.\n",
    "   - **Nodes of Ranvier**: Gaps in the myelin sheath where action potentials are regenerated.\n",
    "   - **Saltatory Conduction**: The process of action potentials jumping from one Node of Ranvier to the next, enhancing speed and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Disease Example**:\n",
    "   - **Multiple Sclerosis**: A condition where myelin is damaged, impairing signal transmission and causing various symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next lecture will cover what happens at the synapse when the action potential reaches it."

    "# 1.5 Making Connections Synapses\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ion Channels and Action Potentials**:\n",
    "   - **Action potentials (spikes)** are generated by ion channels, specifically sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) channels. \n",
    "   - These action potentials propagate along the axon of a neuron, transmitting electrical signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Synapses**:\n",
    "   - **Electrical Synapses**: \n",
    "     - Function via **gap junctions**, which are direct ionic channels connecting two neurons.\n",

    "     - Use **neurotransmitters** (e.g., glutamate) stored in vesicles.\n",
    "     - When an action potential reaches the presynaptic neuron, vesicles release neurotransmitters into the **synaptic cleft**.\n",
    "     - Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, causing ion channels to open and alter membrane potential.\n",
    "     - Chemical synapses allow modulation, making them essential for learning and memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Excitatory and Inhibitory Synapses**:\n",
    "   - **Excitatory Synapses**: Increase the postsynaptic membrane potential, promoting neuron firing.\n",
    "   - **Inhibitory Synapses**: Decrease the postsynaptic membrane potential, reducing neuron firing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hebbian Plasticity (Synaptic Plasticity)**:\n",
    "   - Proposed by Donald Hebb: \"Neurons that fire together wire together.\"\n",
    "   - **Hebbian Rule**: If neuron A repeatedly contributes to the firing of neuron B, the synapse from A to B is strengthened.\n",
    "   - Example: Predictive associations, such as hearing a growl and anticipating danger.\n",
    "   - **Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)**:\n",
    "     - An increase in synaptic strength lasting for hours/days.\n",
    "     - Experimentally observed as an increase in EPSP (Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential) size after repeated stimulation.\n",
    "   - **Long-Term Depression (LTD)**:\n",
    "     - A decrease in synaptic strength, lasting for hours/days.\n",
    "     - Observed as a reduction in EPSP size with repeated stimulation that weakens the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP)**:\n",
    "   - **Timing of spikes** between neurons is crucial for determining whether LTP or LTD occurs.\n",
    "   - **LTP**: When the input (neuron A) fires before the output (neuron B).\n",
    "   - **LTD**: When the input fires after the output.\n",
    "   - **Timing window**: The critical window for STDP is around 40 milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Synapses and Memory**:\n",
    "   - Synapses are believed to be the basis for memory and learning, as proposed by the **Synapse Doctrine**.\n",
    "   - Experiences and skills are stored as changes in synaptic strength in neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Current Research**:\n",
    "   - Ongoing large-scale brain projects (e.g., Human Brain Project, Brain Initiative) aim to map and simulate brain activity to understand how neural networks underlie perception, behavior, and consciousness.\n",
    "\n",
